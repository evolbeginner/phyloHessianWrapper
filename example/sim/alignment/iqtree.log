SUBSTITUTION PROCESS
--------------------

Model of substitution: LG+G4

State frequencies: (model)

Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 1.000

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.137          0.250
  2         0.477          0.250
  3         1.000          0.250
  4         2.386          0.250
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.
